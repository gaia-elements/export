# Gaia Element Export Script

This script provides an easy way to export web components from gaia into the gaia-elements organization. This is a prototype to see what this approach would look like, and to see if it would provide value to the web development community at large.

## Why?

Web components provide a huge amount of value to developers as they don't need to spend time implementing every single detail of the component. There are several problems in gaia that we have not yet solved in order for the canonical repository to live outside of the main repository, so for now this is a test to see if this would be useful or not.
